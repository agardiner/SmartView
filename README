SmartView is a Ruby library for implementing clients that can communicate with Hyperion's SmartView providers.

h2. Hyperion SmartView

Hyperion(r) SmartView for Office is a Microsoft Office Add-In that allows Office products to interact with Oracle's Hyperion Essbase, Hyperion Financial Management, Hyperion Planning and Hyperion Workspace products.

The SmartView Add-In communicates with SmartView Providers via XML over HTTP. This protocol is not published, but is fairly straightforward to reverse engineer. Providers appear to use a common protocol, albeit with some small differences depending on the data source.

h2. SmartView Gem
The SmartView gem provides a Ruby implementation of the SmnartView protocol, allowing Ruby programs to act as clients to SmartView providers. The SmartView gem hides the details of the protocol, and provides a relatively simple interface for Ruby programs that wish to retrieve data and metadata from Hperion Essbase and Financial Management.
